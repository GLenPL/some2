				<h2>
					Preamble & requirements
				</h2>
				<div class="text para">
					This short text is about ordinals. It may contain some maths, but don't worry, it won't hurt. Nonetheless, I think the following requirements should be fullfilled: you may want to know a little about what is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">set</a>, <span class="hoverable" data-secret="And so you know about the various commonly used symbols: &#x2205;, &#x2208;, &#x2282;, &#x22C3;, ...">how we (usually) write them</span> and what is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">function</a>. Additionnaly, if you know the difference between a set and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)">(proper) class</a>, that's good.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Do not hesitate to pause-and-ponder if you ever feel the need. It is a rather complicated subject and, depending on your knowledge and your intuition, it may be hard.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Finally, before we start, I would like to thank Grant Sanderson, who gave me the <span class="foreign-language">impetus</span> to start this project.

				<h2>
					How to count?
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Orders!
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					When counting, one gives an order to things. There is the first thing, the second thing, the third thing, ... and sometimes, when there is nothing at all, there is a total of zero things. As you notice, counting in intrinsically bound to the idea of order.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Not any orders, in fact! When dealing with finite sets, only those which are total orders allows to count. By this, we mean orders on a set such that every two elements $a$ and $b$ are in relation: either $a < b$, $a > b$ or $a = b$. This may seem like an unnecessary remark, but the study of partial orders is particularly interesting (but we won't deal with them here).
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					One order is good, but two is better! Consider the usual ones on $\{0,1,2\}$ and $\{3,4,5\}$? They look different, but are pretty similar: they both have elements, both have a first, second and third element and both doesn't have a fourth element. In fact, they are said to be isomorphic, i.e. up to a change of label, they are identical. I will often use the symbol $a \mapsto b$ to tell "let's rename $a$ into $b$".
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Before moving on, let's ask ourselves what we like when we count. If we are to generalize counting, we need to get rid of a few properties and, most importantly, to keep some. When we count in the usual set $\mathbb{N}$ of the natural integer, we notice something: every subset $S$ of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element (i.e. an element less than any other element in $S$). So, we may want to go with that: every order we'll consider will have this property, and we will call them well-orders.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					An equivalent property to being well-ordered for an ordered set $S$ is that there is no strictly decreasing sequence of elements of $S$. Still using the $\mathbb{N}$ example, try and find a strictly decreasing sequence of integers. If you can't, that's normal, because such a thing does not exists.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					We may now try to find a classification of these order, and for each class, a quintessential order. In fact, we'll do better: first, some fidgeting with well-orders and then a classification.
				</div>
				<h3>
					Numbers?
				</h3>
				<div class="large para">
					Let's look at <span class="hoverable" data-secret="These will be recurring among my examples!">a few particular well-ordered sets</span>. The zeroth one is $A_0 := \emptyset = \{\}$, the first one $A_1 := \{\emptyset\}$, the second $A_2 := \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}$ and the $(n+1)$-th is the set containing all the previous ones, that is $A_{n+1} := \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\} = A_n \cup \{A_n\}$. You first notice that if $n < m$, then $A_n \in A_m$.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					Sidenote here: we often use the notation $a := b$ to say: "let's define $a$ by it being equal to $b$", where $b$ is often complex-looking. This differs from the usual $a = b$ being only a statement: "I state that $a$ and $b$ are equal".
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
				  Let's do the converse: let's define an order by saying that $x < y$ if and only if $x \in y$. This may seem overly complex (and complex it is), but bear with me and look at what we've just done. Starting with the empty set, we created a family of thing that behave just like the plain good old natural numbers. So, rather than calling this family $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, ..., let's say that these are the natural numbers, the ones usually called $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, ...
				</div>
				<div class="pict para">
					<img src="pictures/1-2-3-sets.svg" />
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					Here I come to warn you: from now on, things will get weirder and weirder. For instance, with this definition, a number is both an element and a set; $3$ is a set with three ordered elements, but also the greatest element of $4$.This may look like a weaknes or an overly-complex thing to do, but it will have its use.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					So, why would we do that? Why would we call these things "numbers"? Because saying what a number precisely is is complicated (try it for yourself: how would you define a number?) and here, we just have a nice recipe! To be extra precise, we often call them "ordinal numbers", or simply "ordinals".
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					A closer look at the  process we used to create our natural numbers shows that $n+1 := n \cup \{n\}$. That is, $n+1$ is the union of the set $n$ (so it contains every element that $n$ contains) and of the set containing only $n$. Imagine taking a big box an tossing in it the content of $n$ and then $n$ itself. That big box is now $n+1$.
				</div>
				<h3>
					To infinity!
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					We still want more! And here comes the <span class="foreign-language">deus ex machina</span>, the axiom saving us: the collection of all natural numbers is a set. Let's call it $\omega$. Why does its existence matters ? Because now, we have a new well-order! One that did not previously existed, an infinite one!
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					Before we go further, we should notice that what I called $\omega$ may look like what is usually called $\mathbb{N}$. Why naming it differently? Because I swiped a few things under the rug, some weird technicalities, like that we cannot be sure that $\omega$ and $\mathbb{N}$ are exaclty the same object, that $\mathbb{N}$ do is a set and some other odd stuff. You shouldn't care too much about this, because a teacher once told us that "it is a matter of faith".
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					What does it looks like? It looks like a ladder, like all the finite numbers we just (re-)created,  but an infinite one. It never stops an goes on and on and on forever! Nonetheless, it goes like that in only one direction, only upward; it is solidely rooted in the ground at the step $0$.
				</div>
				<div class="pict para">
					<img src="pictures/omega-ladder.svg"/>
				</div>
				<h3>
					Addition
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					When adding $n$ and $m$, you count "one, two, ..., $n$, $n+1$, ..., $n+m$". In other words, you concatenated the order on $n$ with the one on $m$. Let's do the same with $V$ and $W$, two well-orders. <span class="hoverable" data-secret="One can always rename every elements of the first set to match this condition.">For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that $V \cap W = \emptyset$</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					How do we do it? We simply consider the set $V \cup W$, well-ordered as follows: if you compare two elements from $V$ or from $W$, you keep the old order and every element from $V$ is smaller than every element from $W$. We will call this new well-order $V+W$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Let's try out with $\omega$. Put $V := \{z\}$ and $W := \omega$. Consider the set $(V + W) := \{z,0,1,2, \dots \}$, ordered with $z < 0 < 1 < 2 < \dots$. Well, if we do the following renaming : $z \mapsto 0$, $0 \mapsto 1$, $1 \mapsto 2$, $2 \mapsto 3$,... we have what I called sooner an isomorphism between  $(\{z\}+\omega)$ and $\omega$. Because $V$ is isomorphic to $1$, we may have stumbled upon the fact that $1+ \omega = \omega$. Strange.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					What if we do the opposite? Put $V := \omega$ and $m := \{z\}$? We find the set $(\omega + \{z\}) := \{0,1,2, \dots, z\}$. We have that $(\omega + 1)$ is something entirely new.
				</div>
				<h3>
					Multiplication
				</h3>
				<div class="large para">
					We need multiplication. Again, lets look at small exemple. Put $n := 2$, $m := 3$ and let's look at $n \times m$. The usual way of doing that is with rectangle, of height $n$ and width $m$. To represent it using sets, we'll do the cartesian product, or set multiplication, between $n$ and $m$; that is the set of all possible pairs. So we have $(n\times m) := \{(0;0), (1;0), (0;1), (1;1), (0;2), (1;2)\}$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Again, we'll now need an order on this set! <span class="hoverable" data-secret="a really observed one!">The convention</span> is to give it the anti-lexicographic order. This barbaric piece of jargon means that in order to compare two pairs, you first compare the right-most coordinates of the two pairs and then, if they are equal, the coordinates to the left.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					To be clear, with that mean of ordering in mind, we have $(10,2) > (20,1)$ because $2 > 1$ (and so here, we do not care about the order between $10$ and $20$). We also have $(10,3) < (20,3)$, because $3 = 3$ and then, $10 < 20$. Also, the name lexicographic means "like in a dictionnary", because you compare the first letters of two words and then the second ones, and so on.
				</div>
				<div class="large para">
					In our previous example, we thus have the ordering $(0;0) < (1;0) < (0;1) < (1;1) < (0;2) < (1;2)$, which, by a clever renaming, can be seen as the order on $6 = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$. We've just seen that $2 \times 3 = 6$. Hurray! We could redo this example on $(3 \times 2) := \{(0;0), (1;0), (2;0), (0;1), (1;1), (2;1)\}$, but we wont.
				</div>
				<div class="large para">
					Now, let's see what happens with $V := \omega$ and $W := 2$. We do have $(V \times W) = \{(0;0), (1;0), (2;0), \dots, (0;1), (1;1), (2;1), \dots , \}$. And about the order on that set ? Well, we have $(0;0) < (1;0)<  (2;0) < \dots < (0;1) < (1;1) < (2;1) < \dots$. Here, you may start to wonder : "Have I ever seen that before?". Well, yes, because it looks like a sum, but no, because I skipped it. Try and add $\omega$ to itself: you fisrt have a copy of $\omega$, and then a second one. It looks like $\omega \times 2$ and $\omega + \omega$ are equivalent.
				</div>
				<div class="pict para">
					<img src="pictures/omega-times-two.svg"/>
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					With the same argument, we find out what $\omega \times 3$ and, more generally,  $\omega \times n$, for any $n$ finite, are: it is the concatenation of $n$ infinite ladders. Although it is fun, doing all of this purely by hand is tedious; it is time to power up.
				</div>
				<h3>
					Exponentiation!
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					No surprise here : first, let's see how it works on finite well-orders (aka natural numbers). Put $n := 2$, $m := 3$ and consider $n^m$. If your intuition whispers "$8$", you're correct. But how to see that ? Well, we consider the set of all triplets (also called $3$-uple) made out of elements of $2$. In other words, that is the set of elements of the form $(a;b;c)$ where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are elements of the set $2$. <span class="hoverable" data-secret="2^3 := {(0;0;0), (1;0;0), (0;1;0), (1;1;0), (0;0;1), (1;0;1), (0;1;1), (1;1;1)}">I could list it, but I won't</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					To be extra clear, an element from $2^3$ can be seen as a function from the set $3$ to the set $2$: the element $(0;1;0)$ is the map $0 \mapsto 0$, $1 \mapsto 1$ and $2 \mapsto 0$. To keep the little sanity I still have, let's use notation $a[n]$ to represent the $n$-th element from the tuple $a$, that is to say what one would normally type $a(n)$ if we consider $a$ to be a full-on function.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Again, we're looking for ordinals, so we need an order on that $2^3$ thing. Let's choose the same as before: the anti-lexicographic ordering. So $(0;0;0)$ is the first element, $(1;0;0)$ the second one, then comes $(0;1;0)$, $(1;1;0)$, ... and finally, $(1;1;1)$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Let's generalize! So, we take $V := \omega$, $W := 2$ and we consider the set of all functions $2 \to \omega$. And we give it the anti-lexicographic ordering. But what does it even mean? Well, you already know: here, such a function $f$ is wholly defined by its value on $0$ and on $1$; so it looks like the $2$-uple $(f[0];f[1])$. In fact, the set $\omega ^ 2$ is the set of all pairs of numbers.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Anti-lexicographic still means "first compare the right-most coordinates, and then the one to its left (and so on)", so you know how to deal with that. And now, we can count up to $\omega^3$ and even $\omega^n$, with $n$ any finite ordinal.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Let's try our new operation on $V := \omega$ and $W := \omega$. So we consider $\omega^\omega$ the set of $\omega$-tuple made out of elements of $\omega$, also called "integer sequences", which we'll see as functions $\omega \to \omega$. Although here comes a trap: we cannot use our magical anti-lexicographic ordering in order to have a well-order. Consider the sequence of sequences $u_0 := (1;1;1;1;\dots)$, $u_1 := (0;1;1;1;\dots)$, $u_2 := (0;0;1;1;\dots)$, ... It is a stricly decreasing sequence, the kind we forbid early on.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					We need a way out. We'll find it by restricting our functions to those with finite support. Here, the support of a given sequence (aka function, aka $\omega$-tuple) $f : \omega \to \omega$ is the set of all elements $x$ such that $f[x] \neq 0$. More generally, we can always call $0$ the least element of any well-order (and it always exists) and apply the samee definition.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					This way, elements like $u_0$ and the like are not taken into account and there is no strictly decraesing sequence. This proof is out of reach, so take it as granted.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					The set of finitely-supported functions from $\omega$ to $\omega$ is often denoted $\omega^{(\omega)}$. More generally, the set of finitely-supported functions $W \to V$, with $V$ and $W$ being two well-orders, is denoted $V^{(W)}$.
				</div>
				<div class="pict para">
					You may want a drawing of $\omega^\omega$, but sadly, I don't know of any way to represent it. $\omega$ is a ladder, $\omega\times 2$ is two ladders, and so on, $\omega^2$ is a ladder upon which a ladder is attached to every step, $\omega^3$ is a ladder upon which a a copy of $\omega^2$ is attached to every step, and so on. So $\omega^\omega$ is huge. The one found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinal number's Wikipedia page</a> is not as clear as it seems
				</div>
				<!--<h3>
					Counting?
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					So here we are, with our newly made ordinal numbers, going past infinity. But how do they truly work? Well, first thing first, finite ordinals work like any usual finite (number): you can add them up, multiply, exponentiate and compute things like $2 \times 3^{3^3+1}+3+1$ without thinking about the sets of function with some properties, order, or anything. This means that our generalization work has turned out well.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Here, I could add an extra layer to the already existing never-ending ladder of definition by stating some arithmetic properties of ordinals. I won't, because it would be totally uninteresting to type and to read. Also, it is a very good exercise to try and find some rules, to take a break from reading and start exercising. If you want, there is a whole Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_arithmetic">ordinal arithmetic</a>. You can always come back later!

				<h2>
					Let's count!
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Ordinals?
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
					Now that we know how to handle well-orders, we want an application. Let's work on our fundamental mission: classifying them. Consider the following definition: <span class="statement">an ordinal is a set $\alpha$ consisting only of ordinals and such that if $\beta \in \alpha$, then $\beta \subset \alpha$</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					First, let's break it down. We want every ordinals to be a set consisting of ordinals. This means that <span class="hoverable" data-secret="... and they are, it can be proven, but net's not complexify this.">if $0$, $1$ and $2$ are ordinals</span>, then $\{0,1,2\}$ is a good candidate for being an ordinal, and it is, and we usually call it $3$, but I've already said that. Moreover, because $2 \in 3$, we need $2 \subset 3$. Is it true? Well, $2 = \{0,1\}$ and $3 = \{0,1,2\}$, so yes.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Let's look at $\omega$. Is it an ordinal? Every of its element are ordinals and for any integer $n \in \omega$, we have every smaller integer (the elements of $n$) in $\omega$. So $\omega$ is an ordinal, by our definition.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					But how to work out the ordinality of $\omega \times 2$? And $\omega^2$? And even $\omega^\omega$? We can't do it by hand. So, let's do some theorem-proving. First, we will need our theorem: <span class="statement">every well-order can be associated to an ordinal</span>.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					Before we prove it, we shall understand it: put $W$ a well-order. Consider the function $S$ associating every element $x \in S$ to the subset of $S$ consisting of all the element strictly smaller than $x$ (it is called  the initial segment up to $x$). Imagine you got the set $\{a,b,c\}$, ordered by $a < b < c$. Then $S(a) = \emptyset$, $S(b) = \{a\}$ and $S(c) = \{a,b\}$.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					You notice that all these sets can be well ordered and associated to ordinals, respectively $0$, $1$ and $2$. You also notice that every of these well-orders are smaller than the whole $W$. Also, $W$ can be associated to the ordinal $3$, aka $\{0,1,2\}$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					How do we generalize and prove our theorem? Rather than doing this for every ordinals, we ask ourselves: "what if it isn't true?". In that case, there is a smallest well-order such that it isn't true, call it $W$. We consider the function $i$ associating every element of $W$ with its initial segment. All these subsets are well-orders smaller than $W$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					By hypothesis, all well-orders smaller than $W$ are associated to an ordinal. So, all these subsets $S$ can be associated to an ordinal $o(S)$. This means that $o(i(x))$ is an ordinal, associated to an element $x$ of $W$.
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					But then, the set $\alpha$ of all these ordinals (as in: $\alpha := \{o(i(x)): x \in W\}$) is an ordinal, and it can be associated to $W$. That is absurd, because we jut assumed that $W$ does not correspond to any ordinal. This means that the premise was faulty: such a $W$ does not exist.
				</div>
				<div class="note para">
					What we've just done is a proof <span class="foreign-language">ad absurdum</span>: by assuming something to be true, we show an inconsistency, which means that what we've just assumed isn't correct.
				</div>
				<h3>
					Recursion!
				</h3>
				<div class="text para">
				</div>
				<div class="text para">
					In our last try <span class="hoverable" data-secret="It is a zeugma.">to achieve great heights and things</span>, we were stumbling upon $\omega^{\omega^\omega}$ and so on. But how high can we go? Is there a limit? The answer is no: there is no fixed point after which you can't add one
